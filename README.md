# Basic-Text-Game

# 5/31/19 Update:
With my last commit I’m almost completely finished with I'd consider phase 1 of this project. The core foundation has been set with the save system and travel system being finished. The only thing left bugging me is the fact that the load option comes after the name, race, and sex inputs. That’s not a major issue though.

Next up is phase 2 which will mostly be a story endeavor I wager. I have a good idea of how to implement most things I might need so this phase will likely come along quick once the writing is finished.

At some point I hope to release a proper version. I don’t really feel like the game is at a state now that I would feel confident in other people playing it which is why I’m holding off. Of course the sooner I get something out there the sooner I can start advertising the project and get user feedback. So it’s difficult to figure out what to do. I don’t expect the game to be big, and honestly I’d be surprised if more than 10 people play it. I’d consider anyone but myself playing it to be an absolute win. Who knows though. SFW Furry Text Games are an untapped market, but its also a very very niche market as well.

We’ll see where it all goes. I look forward to developing more open levels and continuing the story. If nothing else the story portion of this project might net some interest on certain websites.
This is a text game (name pending) made by me (Dylan Coleman) as a way to practice python and object orientated programming. 


# About This Project
This text game focuses primarly on the story, as a combat system just didn't really fit the theme of the storying I planned on telling. 

The characters and 'universe' in this game are bit unique, there wasn't really any other examlpes of a SFW game of this nature.
So I took a page out of Thanos’ book and said “Fine, I’ll do it myself”. 
This project allows me to work on something I’m very passionate about and also learn how to program and write creatively. It also allows for lots of expansion opportunities, since there's many ways I could take this game.
I’m working on this over the course of Summer 2019 and beyond, and hope to possibly implement an android version at some point.
