# Tales From the Road

# 6/28/19 Reminder
Just reminding you that good feedback will help me tremendously with developing this project. I’m the only one looking over this project right now, and while I hold myself to what I consider a decent standard, I don’t always pick up on everything. If you have anything you want to say about the project, have any questions, or anything else, please let me know on here or on twitter. My handle on twitter is the same as on here, @Iforgotmybrain.

# 6/17/19 First Release Update

I released the first version of Tales from the Road today, the game is still very much in development but I feel it’s at a point where it can sort of ‘stand on its own’ so to say. Now I can start advertising it. The game was formerly just known as text game but after thinking about it for a while I decided to name it Tales From the Road for the first release. I feel the name fits the game very well considering the later bits of the story are going to be about a road trip.

I won’t really post much of anything on this page anymore, as I have a little blog website set up for posting my thoughts and progress on the game. You can find it on my GitHub page or at https://iforgotmybrain.github.io/

I think that’s about it. Here’s to many more releases!


# 5/31/19 Update:
With my last commit I’m almost completely finished with I'd consider phase 1 of this project. The core foundation has been set with the save system and travel system being finished. The only thing left bugging me is the fact that the load option comes after the name, race, and gender inputs. That’s not a major issue though.

Next up is phase 2 which will mostly be a story endeavor I wager. I have a good idea of how to implement most of the things I might need so this phase will likely come along quick once the writing is finished.

At some point I hope to release a proper version. I don’t really feel like the game is at a that I would feel confident in other people playing it which is why I’m holding off. Of course the sooner I get something out there the sooner I can start advertising the project and gettting user feedback. So it’s difficult to figure out what to do. I don’t expect the game to be big, and honestly I’d be surprised if more than 10 people play it. I’d consider anyone but myself playing it to be an absolute win. Who knows though.

Just have to wait and see where it all goes. I look forward to developing more open levels and continuing the story. If nothing else the story portion of this project might net some interest on short story websites.
This is a text game (name pending) made by me (Dylan/Iforgotmybrain) as a way to practice python and object orientated programming. 


# About This Project
Tales from the Road is a slice of life interactive fiction game. The game features a story about a disgruntled contract worker whose grown bored of their work. The first chapter of the story features an introduction to our core cast of characters and explores the player character’s (PC) dissatisfaction with their current situation. The second chapter expands upon the relationships and backstory of the PC and introduces an important story aspect which will be heavily expanded upon in the future. The script for the story is currently 15,000+ words long, with 2 of the chapters being completed, and the 3rd being a work in progress. I’m planning on around 8 or so total chapters.

This project was created with Python 3.7 in the Pycharm IDE, with the only developer and writer being me. The game features no art other than the itch.io cover page, which was also made by me using a royalty free image from Pixabay.
