# Tails From the Road

# 6/17/19 First Release Update

I released the first version of Tails From the Past today, the game is still very much in development but I feel it’s at a point where it can sort of ‘stand on its own’ so to say. Now I can start advertising it and maybe get more than 1 unique visitors on this page (That’s not happening). The game was formerly just known as text game but after thinking about it for a while I decided to name it Tails From the Past for the first release. I feel the name fits the scope of the game very well considering the story is going to be about a road trip, and the fact that the game is set in a fictional world.

I won’t really post much of anything on this page anymore, as I have a little blog website set up for posting my thoughts and progress on the game. You can find it on my GitHub page or at https://iforgotmybrain.github.io/

I think that’s about it. Here’s to many more releases!


# 5/31/19 Update:
With my last commit I’m almost completely finished with I'd consider phase 1 of this project. The core foundation has been set with the save system and travel system being finished. The only thing left bugging me is the fact that the load option comes after the name, race, and sex inputs. That’s not a major issue though.

Next up is phase 2 which will mostly be a story endeavor I wager. I have a good idea of how to implement most things I might need so this phase will likely come along quick once the writing is finished.

At some point I hope to release a proper version. I don’t really feel like the game is at a state now that I would feel confident in other people playing it which is why I’m holding off. Of course the sooner I get something out there the sooner I can start advertising the project and get user feedback. So it’s difficult to figure out what to do. I don’t expect the game to be big, and honestly I’d be surprised if more than 10 people play it. I’d consider anyone but myself playing it to be an absolute win. Who knows though.

We’ll see where it all goes. I look forward to developing more open levels and continuing the story. If nothing else the story portion of this project might net some interest on certain websites.
This is a text game (name pending) made by me (Dylan Coleman) as a way to practice python and object orientated programming. 


# About This Project
Tails from the Past focuses primarly on the story, as a combat system just didn't really fit the theme of the storying I planned on telling. 

The characters and 'universe' in this game are bit unique, there wasn't really any other examlpes of a text game made in the style I was going for, so I took a page out of Thanos’ book and said “Fine, I’ll do it myself”. 
This project allows me to work on something I’m very passionate about and also learn how to program and write creatively. It also allows for lots of expansion opportunities, since there's so many different ways for me to build upon this game.
I’m working on this over the course of Summer 2019 and beyond, and hope to possibly implement an android version at some point.

I hope you find some enjoyment from playing this game, or find some usefulness in looking at how I implemented certain things in the code. If my code did end up helping you in someway I would love to hear about, just hit me up on twitter or something.
