# Basic-Text-Game
A basic text game made by me as a learning experience 

This is a text game (name pending) made by Dylan Coleman as a way to practice python and object orientated programming. 

This text game will focus heavily on story. The characters in this game are anthromorphic animals. 

Which are more commonly known around internet culture as ‘furries’.

My whole inspiration for this project was the fact there wasn’t a single safe for work furry text adventure game. 

So I took a page out of Thanos’ book and said “Fine, I’ll do it myself”. 

This project allows me to work on something I’m very passionate about and also learn how to program and write creatively. 

I’m working on this over the course of Summer 2019 and hope to possibly implement an android version at some point.
