# Basic-Text-Game
This is a text game (name pending) made by me (Dylan Coleman) as a way to practice python and object orientated programming. 

This text game focuses primarly on the story, as a combat system just didn't really fit the theme of the storying I planned on telling. 

The characters and 'universe' in this game are bit unique, there wasn't really any other examlpes of a SFW game of this nature.
So I took a page out of Thanos’ book and said “Fine, I’ll do it myself”. 
This project allows me to work on something I’m very passionate about and also learn how to program and write creatively. It also allows for lots of expansion opportunities, since there's many ways I could take this game.
I’m working on this over the course of Summer 2019 and beyond, and hope to possibly implement an android version at some point.
